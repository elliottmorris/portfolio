## About me

<hr>

I am a data journalist for _The Economist_ based in Washington, DC. [Proof.](https://mediadirectory.economist.com/people/g-elliott-morris-2/)

This is a single-page site for listing all of my work in one places. Some details are omitted for simplicity's sake. Go to my blog, [thecrosstab.com](https://www.thecrosstab.com), for more information and regular updates.

I also post a lot on Twitter [@gelliottmorris](https://www.twitter.com/gelliottmorris).

I circulate a weekly email to people who want to know more about politics using data. You can read it at [thecrosstab.substack.com](https://thecrosstab.substack.com) or sign up below!

<h3>Who is ahead in the Democratic primary race? </h3> •

<p class='project_text'>
Some of the typical approaches for aggregating polls are too sensitive to phantom swings in the data. We have devised a new method for the Democratic primaries in 2020 that is less jumpy than other approaches. It also takes the quality of each poll into account and corrects for consistent biases in the data.

<h3>If everyone had voted, Hillary Clinton would probably be president </h3> •

<p class='project_text'>
Democratic voters often claim that all they need to do to win election is turn out to vote. There is some truth to this, but the story is not that simple. Using a statistical method called multi-level regression and post-stratification, I answer the question of what would happen if every eligible American actually voted.
