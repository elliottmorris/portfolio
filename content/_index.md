## About me

---

**[I am a data journalist](https://mediadirectory.economist.com/people/g-elliott-morris-2/)** at _The Economist_ based in Washington, DC. I write mostly about American politics and elections, usually by engaging in a close study of political science, political polling and demographic data.

This is a simple site for listing all of my work in one place. Some details are omitted for simplicity's sake. Go to my blog, [thecrosstab.com](https://www.thecrosstab.com), for more information and regular updates.


I also post a lot on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="true">Follow @gelliottmorris</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I circulate a weekly email to people who want to know more about politics using data. You can read it at [thecrosstab.substack.com](https://thecrosstab.substack.com) or sign up below!
